# Project-Portfolio
This is a repository that contains projects I have completed in the past or am working on currently. 

FINAL BACKTEST is the final version of a quantitative algorithmic trading project I completed during my Masters in Finance. It is built upon code from my professor, Travis Johnson, particularly the files portfolio_db and backtest_statistician. I led my team with two other students in the coding aspect of the project as it was my first large project I had completed in Python. 
I am returning to this project now that I have greater knowledge of the language and of greater algorithmic efficiency. As I am currently taking a course on Data Structures and Algorithms by Dr. Calvin Lin at UT Austin in the Masters of Data Science, I am revisiting the project to rectify the very large time requirements of the original code as it is undoubtedly inefficient.
